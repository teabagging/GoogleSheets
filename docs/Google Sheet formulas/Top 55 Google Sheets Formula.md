## **Easily Insert Google Sheets Formulas Using Automatic Suggestions**

To insert formulas and functions into a cell, follow the steps below. Google Sheets will provide you with suggestions on-screen that help you easily select a formula relevant to your data using AI.

If you’re already familiar with how to insert formulas, skip this section and go straight to our Cheat Sheet below:

**Step 1.** In your Google Sheets spreadsheet, type in the equal sign “ **= **” in a cell you want to use.

**Step 2.** You should see suggestions automatically based on your data. If the suggestions aren’t showing up, turn on automatic suggestions by clicking the three-dot icon as shown below. Make sure **Enable formula suggestions** and **named functions suggestions** are checked.

**Step 3.** If the suggestion is different from what you need, type in a letter and Google Sheets will provide you a list of formulas and functions to choose from.

In our example, the suggestion was to use the **Average** formula to calculate the average of the selected cells. Let’s say we’d like to discover the highest number in our table. This is going to require Max to calculate the maximum value in our dataset.

Instead of going with the Average formula, we type in Max and the suggestion will automatically pop up.

**Step 4.** After selecting Max, you will be prompted to select your **Range**. Simply put, the cell range is the selection of cells or rows or columns to be used to perform the action.

![Google sheets formulas pdf 3](https://getfiledrop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Google-sheets-formulas-pdf-3.png "Top 55 Most Useful Google Sheets Formula Cheat Sheet 5")

In this example, Google Sheets automatically suggested the list of numbers under Grades to use in the formula. If you need to change it, you may manually select a different range instead.

**Note:** Alternatively, you can select a range of cells prior to entering a formula. Just highlight the cells you’d like to use then press the Functions icon on your menu bar. If you’re using a lower-resolution display, it might be tucked away under the dropdown icon.

**Step 5.** With your range already selected, press Enter. Congratulations, your cell is now performing calculations on your data!
