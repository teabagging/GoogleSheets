# Google sheet Linkedin Formula 
Custom Google Sheet formula that automatically gets the Linkedin profile of a person/company 👥 

It can be helpful to anyone using Google Sheets as a CRM or recruitment, product feedback, or marketing tool. It saved me a lot of boring copy/pasting, so hopefully, it can save some time for you as well 😎
