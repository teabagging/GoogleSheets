ExtendScript is a dialect of JavaScript used in Photoshop and InDesign scripts.

Each standalone release script is available at https://cdn.sheetjs.com/.

`xlsx.extendscript.js` is a special ExtendScript-compatible build. The script is
carefully assembled to work around ExtendScript quirks. Due to bugs in various
JavaScript minifiers and tools, scripts cannot be compressed or post-processed.

<p><a href={"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-" + current + "/package/dist/xlsx.extendscript.js"}>{"https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-" + current + "/package/dist/xlsx.extendscript.js"}</a> is the URL for {current}</p>

After downloading the script, it can be directly referenced with `#include`:

```c
#include "xlsx.extendscript.js"
```

For local deployments, the scripts can be placed in the `Scripts` folder. The
path is application-specific.

| App       | Location                                                         |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Photoshop | `\Presets\Scripts` within the Application folder                 |
| InDesign  | Windows > Utilities > Scripts, click `â˜°` > "Reveal in Explorer" |

:::note CEP and UXP usage

The ExtendScript build should be used when performing spreadsheet operations
from the host context (within a `jsx` script file).

**CEP**: [The standalone scripts](/docs/getting-started/installation/standalone)
should be added to CEP extension HTML.

**UXP**: [The standalone scripts](/docs/getting-started/installation/standalone)
can be loaded directly in UXP scripts using the `require` function.
