# Google Sheets function list

Google Sheets supports cell formulas typically found in most desktop spreadsheet packages. Functions can be used to create formulas that manipulate data and calculate strings and numbers.

Here's a list of all the functions available in each category. When using them, don't forget to add quotation marks around all function components made of alphabetic characters that aren't referring to cells or columns.

You can [change the language of Google Sheets functions](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/58515#change_function_language) between English and 21 other languages.
