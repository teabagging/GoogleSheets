# Name a range of cells

You can name ranges in Google Sheets to keep better track of them and create cleaner formulas.

For example, instead of using "A1:B2" to describe a range of cells, you could name the range "budget\_total." This way, a formula like "=SUM(A1:B2, D4:E6)" could be written as "=SUM(budget\_total, quarter2)."
