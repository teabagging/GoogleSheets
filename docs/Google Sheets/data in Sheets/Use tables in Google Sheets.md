# Use tables in Google Sheets

In Google Sheets, tables can simplify data creation and reduce the need to repeatedly format, input, and update data by automatically applying format and structure to ranges of data.

Tables are well suited to track and organize information like:

* Project tracking
* Event planning
* Inventory management

There are 2 main parts of a table:

* For each column, you can set the appropriate column type. Your table ensures all data you enter aligns.
* You have access to a unified menu. You can manage table-level settings from the menu and perform actions like create a filter view for your table.

## Convert existing data to a table

1. On your computer, open a Sheet.
2. Select a range of cells, either empty or with data.
3. On the Menu Bar, click** Format** ![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=w36-h36) **Convert to table**.
4. Select the appropriate column type for each column.

For some column types, placeholder chips are auto populated to allow for easy data entry. To turn off placeholder chips for a column:

1. On your computer, open a Sheet with a table.
2. Next to the table header, open the **Column menu**.
3. Click** Edit column type.**
4. Uncheck **Show placeholders**.

## Get started by inserting a pre-built table

You can insert a new table with a predefined structure through templates that cover common use cases.

You can select a template that matches your use case. Go to the:

* @ menu:
  * Click **@ **![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=w36-h36)** Tables**
* Insert menu:
  * Click** Insert **![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=w36-h36)** Tables**

A sidebar opens for both menu options where you can browse, preview, and insert one or multiple pre-built blocks.

## [Set column types]

Table column types help you organize, format your column data, and prevent errors as they report incorrect data types. For example, if you select “Date” as your column type, it shows a warning for cells within the column that don’t follow this type.

You can choose from any of the following types:

* Number
  * Percentage
  * Currency
  * Text
* Date
  * Date
  * Time
  * Date and time
* Dropdown
* Checkbox
* Smart chips
  * People chip
  * File chip
  * Finance chip
  * Place chip
  * Rating chip
* None: If you select this option, we don’t apply a column type to your column. Choose this option if you want a flexible column that can support mixed data types.

## Use table menu

You can control your table settings and further customize it through the table menu. To use the table menu, at the bottom of your table, click Table ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/l49WKooKga5OIlMGlAk86UeisOAFAM2aK27vSg7lbcCMb0jAv6QAfUUJS6_VK2hPaXg=w36-h36)![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=w36-h36) Menu ![More](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7rS3opHhDdyVbVAxGgR_x3w9v7C6fDj_M3-rUXCQb-chdKf2eE1d0811mbhxNrDJkQ=w36-h36).

In the table menu, you can:

* Rename your table
* Adjust table range
* Turn off alternating colors
* Customize your table colors
* Remove table formatting
* Delete your table
* Send feedback

**Tip:** When you convert your data to a table, we automatically apply basic formatting. You can further customize your table and:

* Readjust the row height
* Remove the alternating colors
* Change alternating colors
* Change the font style

## Use table references

Table references are a special way to refer to a table or parts of a table in a formula. When you convert your data to a table, we give it a name, as well as each column header. You can then use those names to reference cells in the table. For example: Instead of explicit cell references: `=Sum(C2:C7)`, you can use table references: `=SUM(DeptSales[Sales Amount])`.

When you reference table elements by name, the references update whenever you add or remove data from the table.

## Use tables views

With views, you can find the data you care about without impacting what others see on the sheet. You can use views to show or hide specific rows and apply other configurations to manage how to visualize data.

Each view can have its own unique configurations to filter and sort.

* To create new views, click Table menu ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/Xyh8TgiQeFOfirxfkAEAFDGB1xSrOhfa4pUN), and then select one of the following:
  * Create group by view
    * This allows you to see rows grouped together based on the field of your choice.
  * Create filter view

**Note:** Temporary views disappear after spreadsheet refreshes.

* To apply existing views, click **Table menu   **![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=w36-h36)** **existing view name.

## Give feedback on tables

If you have any issues or want to change this feature and help us improve, you can submit feedback to us.

To submit feedback:

* Use the “Send feedback” option on the tables menu.
* At the top of your sheet, click **Help **![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=w36-h36)** Help Sheets improve**.
