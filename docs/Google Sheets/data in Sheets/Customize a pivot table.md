You can change how your pivot table data is listed, sorted, summarized, or filtered.

[Computer] [Android][iPhone & iPad]

## Order and sort columns or rows

You can sort and order your data by pivot table row or column names or aggregated values.

1. On your computer, open a spreadsheet in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).
2. Click the pop-up **Edit** button underneath the pivot table.
3. Under "Rows" or "Columns," click the arrow under "Order" or "Sort by."

**Note:** To show the totals of a row or column, check **Show totals**.

## Change how your pivot table looks

[Change header name]

To change the header of a column:

1. On your computer, open a spreadsheet in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).
2. Click the pop-up **Edit** button underneath the pivot table.
3. Click the name of a row or column and enter a new name.

**Note**:

* If you rename a field in Sheets after creating a Pivot Table, Sheets renames the same field in the pivot table editor to a concatenation of **the previous field name** and the **new name in parentheses**. For example, when **AVERAGE price per unit** is renamed to **Average Price** in the Pivot Table, the name of the field becomes **price per unit (Average Price)** in the pivot table editor.
* You can’t rename "Grand Total."

[Show a value as a percentage]

You can show a value (like October sales) as a percentage of a whole (like annual sales).

1. On your computer, open a spreadsheet in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).
2. Click the pop-up **Edit** button underneath the pivot table.
3. Under "Values," under "Show as," click **Default**.
4. Choose an option from the menu.

[Group data together]

You can choose a set of values in a pivot table and group them together manually or with a rule.

1. On your computer, open a spreadsheet in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).
2. Click the pop-up **Edit** button underneath the pivot table.

**To manually group**:

1. Right-click the cells, then click **Create pivot group**.
2. Select the cells you want to group together.

**To group rows together by a rule: **

1. Right-click a cell, then click **Create pivot group rule**.
2. For numbers, choose an interval size. Optional: Choose when your groups start and end.
3. When you are done, click **OK**.

**To group rows together by date or time:**

1. Right-click a cell with date formatted data, then click **Create pivot date group**.
2. Choose a date or time period to group by.

**Optional**: To ungroup, right-click a grouped item, then click **Ungroup pivot items**.

## Filter data in a pivot table

You can hide data that you don’t want to show in your table.

1. On your computer, open a spreadsheet with a pivot table.
2. Click the pop-up **Edit** button underneath the pivot table.
3. At the right, next to "Filters," click **Add**. Then, choose an option.
4. Next to "Showing all items," click the Down arrow ![Down arrow](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7acH9pM1qZl0MEFmPRkOPeuNk48-E7Wbn08-h9yfGXbkMTKHY0kOPqurH20N2jHFwZY=w36-h36).
5. Choose how you want to filter:
   * **Filter by condition**: Write your own, or choose from the list of conditions, like if the cell is not empty, if data is less than a certain number, or if text contains a certain letter or phrase.
   * **Filter by values**: Uncheck the items you want to hide and click **OK**.

### Notes

* If you filter by value then update your source data, you'll need to update your pivot table filter if you want that data to show in the pivot table.
* When you filter by condition, you can enter a value, a cell reference, or a field from your data. For example, if you select "Greater Than," you can enter 10, =Sheet1!A1, or =Revenue, if your data has a field called Revenue.
