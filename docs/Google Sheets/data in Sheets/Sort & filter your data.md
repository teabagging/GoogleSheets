## Create, save, delete, or share a filter view

**Important**: If you only have permission to view a spreadsheet, you can create a temporary filter view that only you can use. Your filter view won’t be saved.

2. Click **Data** ![and then](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Hr84c9LbCYE40aUMQAzvGtJPuGqNQmz54oG9TW4Tp7J01L_JwH7MOAJiSu7Wqkwn9PAApNZSdye1Xb-Wd4UyxWllf1WA_7tBhi0BQW6vuTS7wSrn-bg43k-t0Rv55q7oHY7_tjBk "and then") **Create filter view**.
3. Sort and filter the data.

## Learn more about filters & filter views

Filters and filter views help you analyze a set of data in a spreadsheet.

You can use filters to:

* Show a specific filter when people open your spreadsheet.
* Sort your data after using a filter.

You can use filter views to:

* Save multiple filters.
* Name your filter.
* Let multiple people see different filter views at the same time.
* Share different filters with people.
* Make a copy or create another view with similar rules.
* Filter or sort a spreadsheet you don't have edit access to. In this case, a temporary filter view will be created.

**Tip:** When you have a formula that points to a cell inside a filtered range, note that sorting the filtered range won't change the formula. For example "=B2" will continue to be "=B2" when B2 is within the filtered range.
