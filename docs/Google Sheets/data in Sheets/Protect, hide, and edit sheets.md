# Protect, hide, and edit sheets

[Computer] [Android][iPhone & iPad]

## Protect a sheet or range

If you don’t want people to change the content in a spreadsheet, you can protect it. This shouldn’t be used as a security measure. People can print, copy, paste, and import and export copies of a protected spreadsheet. Only share spreadsheets with people you trust.

**Tip**: If "Protected sheets and ranges" isn't visible, you're likely in Microsoft Office editing. To use sheets and ranges protection, convert your file to Google Sheets.

* Simultaneously lock the formatting of cells and allow users to edit input values
* Protect data with a password

5. Click **Set permissions** or **Change permissions**.
6. Choose how you want to limit editing:

* **To show a warning when anyone makes an edit**: Select "Show a warning when editing this range." It doesn’t block people from editing, but they’ll see a message asking them to confirm if they really want to make an edit.
* **To choose who can edit the range or sheet**: select "Restrict who can edit this range." Choose:
  * **Only you**: Only you (and the owner if you’re not the owner) can edit the range or sheet.
  * **Only domain**: If you use Google Sheets for work or school, only people in your domain can edit the range or sheet. This option is only available when everyone in your domain can edit the spreadsheet.
  * **Custom**: Only the people you choose can edit the range or sheet.
  * **Copy permissions from another range**: Reuse the same permissions you set up on a different set of cells or sheet.
