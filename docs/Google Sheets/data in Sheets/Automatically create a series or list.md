# Automatically create a series or list

You can use autofill to create a series of numbers, letters, or dates in Google Sheets.



## Use autofill to complete a series

1. On your computer, open a spreadsheet in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets).
2. In a column or row, enter text, numbers, or dates in at least two cells next to each other.
3. Highlight the cells. You’ll see a small blue box in the lower right corner.
4. Drag the blue box any number of cells down or across.
   * If the cells form a series of dates or numbers, the series will continue across the selected cells.
   * If the cells don’t form a series of dates or numbers, the list of values will repeat across the selected cells.

**Tip:** You might notice autofill suggestions with a preview of the values. To accept the suggestion, press Command **⌘ **![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=w36-h36)**Enter**.
