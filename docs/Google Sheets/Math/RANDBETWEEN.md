# RANDBETWEEN

Returns a uniformly random integer between two values, inclusive.

### Sample Usage

`RANDBETWEEN(1,10)`

`RANDBETWEEN(A2,A3)`

### Syntax

`RANDBETWEEN(low, high)`

* `low` - The low end of the random range.
* `high` - The high end of the random range.

### Notes

* Values with decimal parts may be used for `low` and/or `high`; this will cause the least and greatest possible values to be the next integer greater than `low` and/or the next integer less than `high`, respectively.
