# IMAGE

Inserts an image into a cell.

**Important:** You can only use URLs that aren't hosted at [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/). SVG file format isn't supported.

Volatility restrictions: you cannot directly or indirectly reference a volatile function in the base URL, the consistent part of the website's address, of the IMAGE function.

* `NOW(), RAND(),Â RANDARRAY(), RANDBETWEEN()` are examples of volatile functions.

### Sample Usage

`IMAGE("https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo3w.png")`

`IMAGE(A2,2)`

`IMAGE(A2,4,120,200)`

### Syntax

`IMAGE(url, [mode], [height], [width])`

* `url` - The URL of the image, including protocol (e.g. `http://`).
  * The value for `url` must either be enclosed in quotation marks or be a reference to a cell containing the appropriate text.
* `mode` - **[** OPTIONAL - `1` by default **]** - The sizing mode for the image
  * `1` resizes the image to fit inside the cell, maintaining aspect ratio.
  * `2` stretches or compresses the image to fit inside the cell, ignoring aspect ratio.
  * `3` leaves the image at original size, which may cause cropping.
  * `4` allows the specification of a custom size.
  * Note that no mode causes the cell to be resized to fit the image.
* `height` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - The height of the image in pixels. `mode` must be set to `4` in order to set a custom height.
* `width` - **[** OPTIONAL **]** - The width of the image in pixels. `mode` must be set to `4` in order to set a custom width.

### Examples

Inserts an image inside of a cell.
