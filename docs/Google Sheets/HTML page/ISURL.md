### Syntax

`ISURL(value)`

* `value` - The value to be verified as a URL.

### Notes

* Google Sheets automatically links text entered into a cell if a valid URL is detected. `ISURL` will return `TRUE` in these cases.
* A fully qualified URL is not required. In other words, "http" and "www" are not needed in all cases.
* Valid protocols include ftp, http, https, gopher, mailto, news, telnet, and aim.
* If a URL is flagged as "False," it may use a top-level domain that isn't on our list.
